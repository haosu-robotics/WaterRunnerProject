The Basilisk Lizard's striking ability to sustain legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to the water is a remarkable feat \cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic}. Currently, most legged robots would have difficulty emulating this animal's ability to robustly locomote on yielding or deforming surfaces. Therefore, to explore the dynamics of legged locomotion in this regime, we are studying the design of a bio-inspired water-running robot. Analyzing water-running dynamics may also help us gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud.
