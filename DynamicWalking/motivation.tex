The Basilisk Lizard's striking ability to sustain legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to the water surface~\cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic} is a remarkable feat. The multi-terrain capability of this animal is a desireable trait that many mobile-robots currently lack. Therefore, to explore the limits of legged locomotion we are studying the design of a bio-inspired water-running robot. Analyzing water-running dynamics may also help us gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud.
