The mechanical design of the water-running robot has undergone several design iterations. The current design, which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:robot}, features four four-bar linkage legs producing  foot trajectories, as in Figure \ref{fig:traj}, optimized for power consumption and lift. Park et al. analyzed the roll and pitch dynamics of this robot and proposed an active tail for achieving stable robot pitch angles \cite{park2010roll}. However, addition of an active tail requires integration of another actuator, adding mass and complexity. Furthermore, no method for controlling roll angles has been proposed as of yet.
