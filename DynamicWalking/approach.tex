To control the roll and pitch motion of the robot we propose a novel, closed-loop CPG that modulates the velocity of each foot during the downwards and upwards phases of their trajectories, while simultaneously maintaining the phase relation between feet. This approach takes advantage of non-linear fluid drag forces to generate differing forces on each foot, thereby imparting moments on the robot. 
	
To deal with the hybrid and time-variant nature of the system we utilize a time averaging approach. We then find the force generated by an approximated foot trajectory in order to yield an expression for the average lift force over a cycle. Finally, we design a non-linear PID controller based on this force law, which attempts to minimize the error between the height of each corner of the robot and a desired height, thereby achieving the desired roll and pitch angles.
