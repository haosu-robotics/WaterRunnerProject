To control the roll and pitch motion of the robot, we propose a novel, closed-loop central pattern generator (CPG) that modulates the velocity of each foot during the downwards and upwards phases of their trajectories using a control input parameter we call duty-factor. This approach takes advantage of non-linear fluid drag to generate differing forces on each foot, thereby imparting moments on the robot. 
	
To deal with the hybrid and time-variant nature of the system we utilize a time averaging approach. We then find the force generated by an approximated foot trajectory in order to yield an expression, which is linear in duty-factor, for the average lift force over a cycle.  Finally, we design a controller, based on this force equation, to achieve a desired spring-like virtual model.
