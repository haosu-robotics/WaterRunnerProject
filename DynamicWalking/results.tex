In order to control the roll and pitch angles of the robot, we must be able to control the height of each corner of the robot. We have achieved preliminary results controlling the height of a one legged hopping robot using the nonlinear control outlined in the previous section. We have found that adding PID to this control scheme in an outer loop can reduce setting time, oscillations about the desired height, and steady state error.
