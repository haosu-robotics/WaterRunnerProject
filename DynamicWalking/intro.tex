\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Motivation}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Basilisk Lizard can sustain highly dynamic legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to water \cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic}
	\item This level of multiterrain locomotion facility is unseen in robotics
    \item We wish to develop an amphibious legged robotic system
    \item Gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{2EX}

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Problem}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Current robot generates sufficient lift forces
    \item Unstable in roll and pitch
    \item Undesired pitching motion was remedied by adding a tail~\cite{park2010roll}
    \item No proposed method for controlling roll or height
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2EX}

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Objective}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose a controller to regulate roll and height 
	\item Controller must also maintain a trot gait to minimize torques on the body
\end{itemize}
