<h1>Water Runner Board Problems</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use absolute encoders instead of incremental encoders
<ul>
<li>Absolute encoders output analog signal proportional to the angle</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vias near diodes are too close to pads, causing shorts</li>
<li>Use JST ZE series connectors everywhere instead of JST NSH connectors
<ul>
<li>NSH connectors are too small requiring small wire that breaks easily</li>
<li>28 gauge wire we have for the current ZE connector on the board is <br />
thicker than usual and barely fits</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Do not put any circuitry above the Arduino's USB connection as it is grounded
<ul>
<li>A ground plane covering this area is acceptable</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Screw terminal for +7V line is not necessary
<ul>
<li>Use Arduino power supply instead</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
