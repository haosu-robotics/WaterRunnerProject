Previous work on a biologically-inspired quadrupedal water runner robot demonstrated successful stabilization of robot pitch motions through the use of an active tail. This approach however, has two drawbacks: it necessitates the integration of an additional actuator and  it cannot control roll motions. This paper proposes a novel approach for controlling roll and pitch motions for legged robots locomoting on the water surface. First, A simple model for legged water surface dynamics is developed. A control parameter, duty factor, which governs the timing of the plunge and retract phases of the foot trajectory is introduced, and a roll and pitch motion control strategy that uses this parameter is proposed. This control strategy is then applied to a detailed model of the actual water runner robot, and simulated experimental results are reported.
