The best possible outcome for this project is that our proposed controller robustly stabilizes the roll, pitch and height of the water runner robot in simulation. This outcome will require that we adhere to the following schedule, which outlines how complexity will be added to our model and controller:

\begin{table}[htb]

	\begin{tabular}{lcc}
		\textbf{Task} & \textbf{Start} & \textbf{End} \\ \hline
		1-DOF Hopper & 3/10/13 & 3/23/13 \\
		3-DOF Planer  & 3/17/13 & 3/30/13 \\

		6-DOF QuadHopper & 3/24/13 & 4/6/13 \\
		SimMechanics Robot  & 3/10/13 & 4/21/13 \\
