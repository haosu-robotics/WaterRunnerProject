Previous work on a biologically-inspired quadrupedal water runner robot demonstrated successful stabilization of robot pitch motions through the use of a passive tail. 
However, no method for controlling rolling motion or robot height has been proposed. 
This paper presents an approach for controlling the roll and height of legged robots running on the water surface. 
First, we develop a simple model for legged water surface dynamics that maps leg velocities to forces. 
We then formulate an inverse dynamics control strategy based on this model that produces leg velocities that regulate the robot's height and roll angle. 
This control strategy is then applied to a detailed model of the water runner robot, and simulated experimental results are reported.
