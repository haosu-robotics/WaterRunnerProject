Previous work on a biologically-inspired quadrupedal water runner robot demonstrated successful stabilization of robot pitch motions through the use of a passive tail. 
However, no method for controlling roll motions or robot height has been proposed. 
This paper presents an approach for controlling the roll and height of legged robots running on the water surface. 
First, we develop a simple model for water surface legged locomotion dynamics that maps leg velocities to forces. 
We then formulate an inverse dynamics control strategy based on this model that produces leg velocities in order to regulate the robot's height and roll angle. 
This control strategy is then applied to a detailed model of the water runner robot, and simulated experimental results are reported.
