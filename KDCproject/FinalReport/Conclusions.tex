In this work, we developed a linear model for the dynamics of a Water Running Robot, formulated an inverse dynamics controller based on this model, and demonstrated its effectiveness against sinusoidal disturbance torques in simulation. However, in order to truly gauge the performance of the controller, we must test it on a real robot. This step is crucial, as in there are a number of unmodeled complications that will arise during real-world testing. These include but are not limited to, splashing and waves produced by the feet, motor dynamics, and sensor noise. Future work on the controller will address the issue of gait control using a central pattern generator or other techniques.
