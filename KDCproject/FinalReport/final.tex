\section{INTRODUCTION}
The Basilisk Lizard's striking ability to sustain highly dynamic legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to water is a remarkable feat \cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic}. Most legged robots would have difficulty emulating this animal's ability to robustly locomote on yielding or deforming surfaces. Therefore, to explore the dynamics of legged locomotion in this regime, we are studying the design of a bio-inspired water-running robot. Analyzing water-running dynamics may also help us gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud. It is crucial that we develop locomotion models for these surfaces as robots continue to venture out of the laboratory and into the real world.

%\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
