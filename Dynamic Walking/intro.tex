The Basilisk Lizard's can sustain highly dynamic legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to water \cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic}. Currently, this level of multiterrain locomotion facility is unseen in robotics

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Motivation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop an amphibious legged robotic system.
    \item Gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud.
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Current Robot~\cite{park2010roll}}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can generate sufficient lift forces
    \item Unstable in roll and pitch
    \item Undesired pitching motion was remedied by adding a tail
    \item No proposed method for controlling roll or height
    \item A trot gait is crucial for minimizing torques on body
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1EX}

In this work, we propose a controller to actively regulate roll and height while maintaining a trot gait.
