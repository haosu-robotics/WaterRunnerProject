Hopper
======

This folder contains open-loop and controlled models of a simplified Water Runner robot. Whereas the real robot moves its feet along a trajectory prescribed by a four bar mechanism, the Hopper models move their feet along a vertical prismatic joint. The purely vertical foot path is one of the key assumptions used to calculate the average force generated by the real robot as well. The hopper models underwent several evolutions, starting with one leg, then moving to two and four legs, and finally adding controls similar to those eventually implemented on the real robot. These models are very simple and simulated quickly, yet they capture essential dynamics of the water running robot. Therefore, they can be used to test new controllers quickly.
