IROS Paper
============

This folder contains an incomplete IROS paper. It contains an earlier version of the force averaging over a simplified trajectory, where the input variables were the average speed around the trajectory, and the duty factor, defined as the time spent on the plunge phase over the total duration of the cycle. In later works the input variables were changed to plunge speed and retract speed so that the elements in the vector of control inputs all have the same units.
