\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Motivation}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Basilisk Lizard can sustain highly dynamic legged locomotion on a range of surfaces from hard-ground to water~\cite{glasheen1996hydrodynamic}
	\item This level of multiterrain locomotion facility is unseen in robotics
    \item We wish to develop an amphibious legged robotic system
    \item Gain insight into mobility on other yielding surfaces, such as granular media and mud
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{2EX}

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Previous Work and Problem}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prototype water running robot generates sufficient lift forces
    \item Unstable in roll and pitch
    \item Undesired pitching motion was remedied by adding a tail~\cite{park2010roll}
    \item No proposed method for controlling roll or height
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2EX}

\textcolor{prime}{\textsf{Objective}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Design a controller to regulate roll and height 
    \item Develop a tractable model of the system to improve controller effectiveness
	\item Controller must simultaneously maintain a trot gait to minimize torques on the body
\end{itemize}
