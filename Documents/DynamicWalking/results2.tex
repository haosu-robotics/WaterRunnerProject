\begin{itemize}
\item When the heuristic is not used, (\ref{fig:woheu}), the system can leave a trot gait and quickly becomes unstable at higher amplitude disturbances.

\item When the heuristic to guide the system back to a trot gait is used, (\ref{fig:wheu}), the system can reject higher amplitude disturbances and maintain a trot gait.
