Water-Runner-Simulation
=======================

This directory contains models built using Simulink SimMechanics First Generation. The water running models have been ported to SimMechanics Second Generation and are therefore largely obsolete. However, the ground running models have not yet been fully ported.
Water
-----

This folder contains models of the water runner robot on water and various controllers that attempt to stabilize its motion.

Main
----

This folder contains a Simulink library that is used to build the Water Runner Models in the Water/ and Ground/ directories.

Ground
------

This folder contains Simulink models of a water running robot on hard ground. The ground contact model is curtosey of Hartmut Geyer's group.
